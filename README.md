Advanced Algorithims Projects. 
One of the Assignments for my Advanced Algorithims class:

Consider an NÃ—N grid in which some squares are occupied (see figure
below).  The squares belong to the same group if they share a common edge.  In the figure there is
one group of four occupied squares, three groups of two squares, and two individual occupied squares.
Assume the grid is represented by a 2 dimensional array.  Write a program that:


(a)  Compute the size of a group when a square in the group is given.

(b)  Computes the number of given groups.

(c)  Lists all groups.
